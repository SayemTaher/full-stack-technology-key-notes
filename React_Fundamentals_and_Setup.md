# React Fundamentals

## 1. What is React?

React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs) where efficient rendering is essential. It enables developers to create reusable UI components, manage dynamic data, and handle application state effectively.

---

## 2. Key Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Each component represents a reusable part of the UI. Components can be functional (simple and stateless) or class-based (with more control over lifecycle methods).

#### Example of a Functional Component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

### JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but is written within JavaScript. JSX allows React developers to write UI elements directly within JavaScript code.

#### Example:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

### Props

Props (short for "properties") are inputs to components. They are read-only and passed down from parent to child components to convey data.

#### Example:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

### State

State is a built-in React object that holds data or information about the component. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be updated, allowing dynamic interactions.

#### Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Lifecycle Methods

Lifecycle methods allow class components to handle events during a component’s lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.

#### Example:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Timer extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component mounted");
  }
  
  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  }
  
  render() {
    return <p>Timer Component</p>;
  }
}

export default Timer;
```

# Setting Up React with Tailwind CSS

Follow these steps to set up a new React project with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 1. Installing React

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
2. **Create a React App**: Run the following command in your terminal to create a new React app:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

This command sets up a React project with all necessary files and dependencies.

---

## 2. Setting Up Tailwind CSS

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**: From within your React project directory (`my-app`), install Tailwind and other dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

   This command sets up Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer, essential for styling and compatibility.

2. **Configure Tailwind**: Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and add the following content paths:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind to CSS**: In the `src/index.css` file, include the following lines to import Tailwind’s base styles:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start your React app with Tailwind CSS:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will open your React app in the browser, ready to use with Tailwind CSS.

---

## 3. Creating Components with Tailwind CSS

Once Tailwind is set up, you can start using Tailwind classes within your React components to style them.

#### Example:

```javascript
function StyledButton() {
  return (
    <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}

export default StyledButton;
```

In this example, `StyledButton` uses Tailwind utility classes to style the button with colors, padding, and rounded corners.

## Overview

This guide provides an overview of React fundamentals and explains how to set up a React project with Tailwind CSS. 
Using Tailwind CSS with React allows you to build responsive, modern UIs quickly and efficiently, making it an excellent choice for beginners in front-end development.


## 4. Routing with React Router

React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different components in a single-page application (SPA) without refreshing the page.

### Installation

To install React Router, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Basic Setup

1. **Import Components**: Import `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Routes` in your main `App.js` file:

   ```javascript
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
   import Home from './components/Home';
   import About from './components/About';
   ```

2. **Define Routes**: Wrap your components with `Router` and define paths for each component using `Route`:

   ```javascript
   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
           <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

### Example:

This example sets up a basic navigation between a `Home` and an `About` page:

- **Home.js**

   ```javascript
   function Home() {
     return <h2>Welcome to the Home Page!</h2>;
   }

   export default Home;
   ```

- **About.js**

   ```javascript
   function About() {
     return <h2>About Us</h2>;
   }

   export default About;
   ```

When users navigate to `/about`, the `About` component will be rendered without reloading the page.

## 5. State Management with Context API

The Context API in React is used to share data across multiple components without prop drilling. It allows you to create a global state accessible to any component in the app.

### Basic Setup

1. **Create Context**: In a separate file (e.g., `UserContext.js`), create a context and define its provider.

   ```javascript
   import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

   export const UserContext = createContext();

   export const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

     return (
       <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
         {children}
       </UserContext.Provider>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Wrap the Application**: Wrap the `UserProvider` around the main application in `index.js`:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import App from './App';
   import { UserProvider } from './UserContext';

   ReactDOM.render(
     <UserProvider>
       <App />
     </UserProvider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

3. **Access Context in Components**: Use the `useContext` hook to access context data in any component.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useContext } from 'react';
   import { UserContext } from './UserContext';

   function Profile() {
     const { user, setUser } = useContext(UserContext);

     return (
       <div>
         {user ? <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1> : <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: "John" })}>Log in</button>}
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default Profile;
   ```

In this example, the `Profile` component accesses the user data from the context. If the user is not logged in, a "Log in" button is displayed, setting the user’s name when clicked.
