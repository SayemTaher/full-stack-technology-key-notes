# Next.js Fundamentals

## 1. What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework developed by Vercel that provides features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, 
dynamic routing, and API routes out of the box. Next.js is highly favored for building SEO-friendly, high-performance applications.

---

## 2. Key Features

### File-Based Routing

Next.js provides a built-in file-based routing system. Any file created in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route.

#### Example:

Create a new file `about.js` in the `pages` folder:

```javascript
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>;
}
```

Visiting `/about` in the browser renders the `About` component without additional configuration.

---

### Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing in Next.js allows you to create pages based on dynamic parameters, such as user IDs or product IDs.

#### Example:

1. **Create a Dynamic Route**: Add a file with square brackets (e.g., `[id].js`) in the `pages` directory:

   ```javascript
   // pages/posts/[id].js
   import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

   export default function Post() {
     const router = useRouter();
     const { id } = router.query;

     return <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. **Access the Dynamic Route**: Navigate to `/posts/1` to see "Post ID: 1" displayed. The `[id].js` file dynamically renders content based on the `id` parameter.

---

### Data Fetching (Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering)

Next.js provides two primary ways to fetch data in components: **Static Generation** and **Server-Side Rendering**.

- **Static Generation (`getStaticProps`)**: Fetches data at build time, suitable for content that doesn’t change often.
- **Server-Side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`)**: Fetches data on each request, ideal for frequently updated content.

#### Example of `getStaticProps`:

```javascript
// pages/posts.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { posts },
  };
}

export default function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code fetches data at build time, creating a static page that displays a list of posts.

#### Example of `getServerSideProps`:

```javascript
// pages/profile.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/profile');
  const profile = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { profile },
  };
}

export default function Profile({ profile }) {
  return <h1>Welcome, {profile.name}!</h1>;
}
```

In this example, data is fetched on each request, making it ideal for user-specific data that may change often.

---

### API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API endpoints by placing files in the `pages/api` directory. Each file in this folder represents an API route.

#### Example:

Create an API endpoint in `pages/api/greet.js`:

```javascript
// pages/api/greet.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello from Next.js API!" });
}
```

This endpoint can be accessed at `/api/greet` and will return a JSON response with the message.

# Setting Up Next.js with Tailwind CSS

Follow these steps to set up a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 1. Installing Next.js

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
2. **Create a Next.js App**: Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js app:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-next-app
   cd my-next-app
   ```

This command sets up a Next.js project with all necessary files and dependencies.

---

## 2. Setting Up Tailwind CSS

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**: From within your Next.js project directory (`my-next-app`), install Tailwind and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind**: Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and add the following content paths:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind to CSS**: In the `styles/globals.css` file, include the following lines to import Tailwind’s base styles:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start your Next.js app with Tailwind CSS:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will open your Next.js app in the browser, ready to use with Tailwind CSS.

---

## 3. Creating Components with Tailwind CSS

Once Tailwind is set up, you can start using Tailwind classes within your Next.js components to style them.

#### Example:

```javascript
function StyledButton() {
  return (
    <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}

export default StyledButton;
```

In this example, `StyledButton` uses Tailwind utility classes to style the button with colors, padding, and rounded corners.
